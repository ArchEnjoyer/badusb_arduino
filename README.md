# badusb_arduino

this is a pair of simple arduino scripts. One of them turns on my website, rickrolls some guy in front of computer and that turns off power. Works only on linux, windows must die. Another one (mouse.ino) just don't let you use mouse until you have arduino in usb port.

Recommend you use your own website)
